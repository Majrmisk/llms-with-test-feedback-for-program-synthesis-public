Function: solve_cryptarithmetic(puzzle: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, int]]
Description: Given a cryptarithmetic puzzle in the format "SEND+MORE=MONEY", determine whether there exists a valid assignment of digits (0â€“9) to the letters such that the arithmetic equation holds true. The function must ensure that no number has a leading zero. It should employ recursion and backtracking to systematically try all possible digit assignments, prune invalid partial solutions (e.g., when the partial sums already violate arithmetic constraints), and ultimately return a dictionary mapping each letter to its corresponding digit if a solution is found, or None if no solution exists.
