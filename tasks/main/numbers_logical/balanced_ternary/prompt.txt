Function: balanced_ternary(n: int) -> str
Description: Given an integer n, convert it to its balanced ternary representation. In balanced ternary, each digit can be -1, 0, or 1, represented by '-' for -1, '0' for 0, and '+' for 1. The representation is based on powers of 3, with the most significant digit corresponding to the highest power of 3 needed to express n. The algorithm should correctly handle both positive and negative integers and return "0" when n is zero. For example, balanced_ternary(5) should return "+--" because 5 = (1 * 9) + (-1 * 3) + (-1 * 1) = 9 - 3 - 1 = 5
