Function: collatz_steps_to_reach(n: int, target: int) -> int
Description: Given two integers n (the starting value) and target, this function calculates how many steps it takes for the Collatz sequence beginning at n to first reach target. The Collatz sequence is defined as follows: If the current number is even, the next number is current // 2. If the current number is odd, the next number is 3 * current + 1. The function iterates this sequence step by step. If target is reached, it returns the number of steps required. If the sequence does not reach target within 10,000 steps, the function returns -1. If n already equals target, the function returns 0.
