Function: custom_regex_match(s: str, pattern: str) -> bool
Description:
Implement a custom regex engine that determines whether the entire string s matches the regex pattern—without using any built‐in regex libraries. The engine must support exactly these features:

Literal Characters: Each ordinary character matches itself.
Wildcard (.): Matches any single character.
Kleene Star (*): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Plus Quantifier (+): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Question Mark (?): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
A bracketed expression (e.g., [abc]) matches any one character listed.
Ranges (e.g., [a-z]) are supported.
Partial matches are not allowed.
