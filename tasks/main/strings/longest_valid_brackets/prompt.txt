Function: longest_valid_brackets(s: str) -> int
Description: Given a string s containing the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}', implement a function that returns the largest amount of brackets in the string that form a valid bracket sequence. A valid sequence requires every opening bracket to be correctly matched with the corresponding closing bracket in the proper order, supporting both nested and adjacent valid segments. The function must accurately handle all three types of brackets and compute the maximum length of any well-formed bracket substring within s. The function should completely ignore npn-bracket characters and they should not count towards the  in any way.
