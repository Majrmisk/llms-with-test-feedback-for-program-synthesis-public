Function: custom_regex_match(s: str, pattern: str) -> bool
Description:
Implement a custom regex engine that determines whether the entire string s matches the regex pattern—without using any built‐in regex libraries.

Literal Characters: Each ordinary character matches itself.
Wildcard (.): Matches any single character.
Kleene Star (*): Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Plus Quantifier (+): Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
Question Mark (?): Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.

The function should support only these special characters: Liteeral Character, Wildcard, Kleene Star, Plus Quatifier. and all other characters should have no special meaning.
